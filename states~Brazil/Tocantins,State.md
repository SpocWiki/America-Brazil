## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Tocantins** (Brazilian Portuguese: [tokɐ̃ˈtʃĩs] ) is one of the 26 states of Brazil. 
> 
> It is the newest state, formed in 1988 and encompassing 
> what had formerly been the northern two-fifths of the state of Goiás. 
> 
> Tocantins covers 277,620.91 square kilometres (107,190.03 sq mi) 
> and had an estimated population of 1,496,880 in 2014. 
> 
> Construction of its capital, Palmas, began in 1989; 
> most of the other cities in the state date to the Portuguese colonial period. 
> 
> With the exception of Araguaína, 
> there are few other cities with a significant population in the state. 
> 
> The government has invested in a new capital, a major hydropower dam, 
> railroads and related infrastructure to develop this primarily agricultural area. 
> 
> The state has 0.75% of the Brazilian population and is responsible for 0.5% of the Brazilian GDP.
>
> Tocantins has attracted hundreds of thousands of new residents, primarily to Palmas. 
> It is building on its hydropower resources. 
> 
> The Araguaia and [[../../../../../WikiData/Tocantins_River|Tocantins_River]]s drain 
> the largest watershed that lies entirely inside Brazilian territory. 
> 
> The Rio Tocantins has been dammed for hydropower, 
> creating a large reservoir that has become a center of recreation. 
> 
> Because it is in the central zone of the country, Tocantins has characteristics of the Amazon Basin, 
> and also semi-open pastures, known as cerrado. 
> 
> The Bananal Island (Ilha do Bananal), in the southwest of the State, 
> is the second largest fluvial island in the world. 
> 
> Tocantins is also home to the Araguaia National Park, the Carajás Indian reservations, 
> and Jalapão State Park, which is about 250 kilometres (160 mi) from Palmas. 
> 
> There, the rivers create oases in the dry landscape, attracting many ecotourists to the region.
